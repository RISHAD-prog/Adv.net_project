This projrct is build for my academic purpose and I have used .NET MVC for backend and Razor for front-end in this project. This project is for a NGO who will collect the food from the restaurents and these foods will be distributed to the people who cannot get enough food.
There are some feature list:
* login and registration for the user. 
* Here, different user has different roles.
* Restaurents have to create an account to place the request for collecting food. 
* An admin can assign a employee to collect the food.
* An employee can see their list of foods that they need to collect.
* After that the list will be added into the history of the employee.
* Admin can manipulate the users. 
* There is CRUD operations available.
